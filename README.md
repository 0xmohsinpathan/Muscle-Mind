## Muscle Mind Fitness Application

Muscle Mind is a fitness application built on Phoenix LiveView, designed to help you track your workouts, visualize your progress, access an exercise library, and compete on a real-time scoreboard. Additionally, the app provides a workout history page to keep track of your previous sessions.


## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of Muscle Mind, several valuable lessons were learned. Here are some key takeaways from the project:

* **Don't shy away from seeking help** : It's important to recognize that asking for help and collaborating with others can greatly enhance the development process. Don't hesitate to reach out to the community or individuals with expertise in specific areas when facing challenges or seeking guidance.

* **Exploring Phoenix LiveView and Live Components** : Muscle Mind provided an opportunity to dive deep into Phoenix LiveView and Live Components. The project helped in gaining a better understanding of the real-time interactivity and powerful features offered by LiveView, enabling a more responsive and dynamic user experience.

* **Working with Ecto and the database** : Muscle Mind's integration with Ecto, the database wrapper for Elixir, allowed for seamless communication with the database. This experience provided insights into how to design and maintain a well-structured database schema, handle migrations, and efficiently query data for different application features.

* **Utilizing nested forms** : Implementing nested forms in Muscle Mind was a valuable learning experience. I discovered how to handle complex data structures and relationships, allowing users to log multiple exercises, sets, and reps within a single workout session. Nested forms provided a clean and intuitive user interface for data entry.

* **Leveraging code generation in Phoenix** : The Phoenix framework's code generation capabilities proved to be a valuable asset. Using Phoenix generators, I efficiently scaffolded initial code structures, including models, controllers, views, and templates. This allowed me to focus more on the specific application logic and functionality.

By embracing these lessons learned, I have strengthened my skills in web development using Elixir and Phoenix, and I look forward to applying these insights in future projects.

## Credits

Credit is due to the website [uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/) for providing us with their amazing UI elements, which we are free to use in our application.

*Their CSS button styles have greatly improved the visual appeal of our project, and I am thankful for their talent and generosity in sharing them.*

To create an exercise library using CSV file, I utilized two CSV files: the [Gym Exercise Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/gym-exercise-data) and [Fitness Exercises](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edoardoba/fitness-exercises-with-animations). By extracting the necessary information from both files, I was able to convert the data into Elixir code. An example of this process can be found on my GitHub repository titled [CSV_file_convert_to_Elixir_code](https://github.com/0xmohsinpathan/CSV_file_convert_to_Elixir_code).
